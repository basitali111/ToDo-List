I apologize for the mistake. I will rewrite the README file according to the To-Do list project. Here is the revised version:

# To-Do List with ES6

## Description

This project is a simple web application that allows users to create and manage their own list of tasks. The application uses JavaScript ES6 features and Webpack to bundle the modules.

I built this project as part of the Microverse program to practice my skills in JavaScript ES6 syntax, modules, classes, objects, arrays, and Webpack configuration.

The main features of this project are:

- Responsive design for mobile and desktop screens
- Dynamic creation and rendering of HTML elements using JavaScript
- Local storage of task data using the browser's storage API
- Drag and drop functionality to reorder the tasks
- Editing and deleting tasks
- Marking tasks as completed or not
- Filtering tasks by status
